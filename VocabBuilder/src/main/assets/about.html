<b>Star Rating System</b>
 
 <p>

Vocab Builder is unique from other vocabulary building software in a way it employs flexible star rating system.
It makes no assumption regarding your current level of vocabulary or the words you find easy/difficulty.
 <p>
Instead, it allows you to mark words in 3 different categories
<ul>
<li>Zero star</li>
<li>Half Star</li>
<li>Full star</li>
</ul>

<br/>
It is up to you to give semantic meaning to the star.
 <p>
  <ul>
<li>For people with strong vocabulary, a star can be given to few words they have trouble learning.</li>

<li>For people who are just beginning to learn words, a star can be given to words they have already learnt.</li>
</ul>

<p> 
Notification system allows you to specify what star level words you want to be shown in notifications.
<p>
A statistics page give percentage of each of starred, half starred and un-starred words.
